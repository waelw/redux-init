# Redux folder structure initiator 
This extension came from my laziness of typing the files name of the redux files and because I love using redux this way and with this folder structure.
It keeps everything tidy, clean, and most important manageable.

## Main features

- ### Redux main files setup:
Simply by using the command palette by pressing Ctrl + shift +p
Then typing the command redux-init
It will simply clone my preferred folder structure which I found most easily to interact.

**be attention that you should instantiate your folder structure with src folder
I will handle errors more clearly in next versions**

- ### Reducer main files setup:
This command will run the previous command if there no store or root reducer found it will take a reducer name and make a directory named with the name of the reducer also it will include three files the reducer file , action file and type files 
You can't run it by typing in the command palette reducer-init
